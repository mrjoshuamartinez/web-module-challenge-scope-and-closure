/* ### Task 3 - Stretch Goals

After you have completed the requirements, **create** a new file called `stretch.js` and practice more with closures. There are no tests for these problems.

See if you can complete one or more of the following challenges:

1. Predict the output of the code below and explain why this is the output using what you learned today. When you're ready for answers, view an explanation [here](https://www.coderbyte.com/algorithm/3-common-javascript-closure-questions

*/

(function(){
  var a = b = 3;
})();
console.log("a defined? " + (typeof a !== 'undefined')); // False
console.log("b defined? " + (typeof b !== 'undefined')); // True

/*

2. Write a function that would allow you to do this using a closure. (This is another interview question we've seen before - when you're ready for answers, view an explanation [here](https://www.coderbyte.com/algorithm/3-common-javascript-closure-questions)).
*/


function createBase(numBase) {
  return function(numSix) {
    return numBase + numSix;
  }
}

var addSix = createBase(6);
console.log(addSix(10)); // returns 16
console.log(addSix(21)); // returns 27

/*
3. Research the differences between functional programming and object oriented programming. Then, describe the pros and cons of functional programming vs object-oriented programming. This is a common interview question and great practice!
